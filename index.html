        <h2> Join me on my favourite trails</h2>
        <p> Find inspiration and useful information for your next adventure 
            in the remote wilderness of the North. I have hiked in the most beautiful national parks 
            in <a href="sweden.html">Sweden</a>, <a href="norway.html"> Norway</a> and <a href="iceland.html">Iceland</a> 
            and I will share my experiences and tips for trekking in these stunning landscapes. Follow me and you will be 
            rewarded with breathtaking views, unique wildlife encounters and a sense of peace and tranquility 
            that is hard to find in our busy lives. All you need is a tent, good walking boots and a passion for the great outdoors.</p>
        <p> I am planning to have more adventures and will be adding more locations to this collection so watch this space!</p>
