        <h2>Sweden: Sarek National Park</h2>
        <p>Trekking in Sarek National Park is a raw and unforgettable adventure through one of 
            Europe's last true wildernesses. Located in Swedish Lapland above the Arctic Circle, 
            Sarek is known for its rugged mountain ranges, deep valleys, wild rivers, and complete lack of 
            marked trails or accommodations, offering a true back-to-nature experience. 
            Hikers must be self-sufficient and prepared for rapidly changing weather, but the rewards are 
            immense—encounters with reindeer herds, panoramic views of untouched landscapes, 
            and a profound sense of solitude and connection with nature. It is a challenging yet deeply rewarding 
            destination for experienced trekkers seeking authenticity and adventure.</p>
